# [Project name]

## Build instructions
From the `code` directory:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

If, over the course of development, you ever encounter any problems building, a recommended method of troubleshooting is to first, delete the `build` directory you created above, and to retry building from scratch.
