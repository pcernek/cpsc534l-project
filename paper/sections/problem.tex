In this section we formally define the notation and the problem we will be dealing with.
\subsection{Set-up}

\subsubsection{Person and skill}

We consider the input to our problem to include an existing organization.
We use the notation $\hiredset$ to denote the set of individuals who are already part of the organization.
Additionally, a set of candidates is denoted by $\candidates$.
Every individual person $p \in \{\hiredset \cup \candidates\}$ has a set of skills.
We use $\skill(p)$ to denote the skills of person $p$.
The skills of a set of persons $\persons$ is $\skill(\persons) = \cup_{p \in \persons} \skill(p)$.

The universe of skills is denoted by the set $\skills = \{ \skill_1, ..., \skill_m \}$.

\subsubsection{Task Distribution}

A task $\task$ is nothing but the set of skills that are required to complete the task.
We write $\skill_i \in \task$ if $\skill_i$ is required to complete the task $\task$.

Most organizations cannot predict in advance the exact requirements of the tasks they will be required to complete.
We model this uncertainty using a task distribution $\tasks$. 
A task $\task \sim \tasks$ is associated with a probability.
Define $Pr[\task]$ to denote the probability with which the organization will be required to complete the task $\task$. 
As the organization wishes to maximize the number of tasks it completes, it naturally places higher priority on being able to complete high probability tasks.

\subsubsection{Communication cost and utility}

As stated earlier, the individuals constitute the nodes of a graph whose edges denote communication channels between pairs of individuals.
The edges are weighted according to the communication cost between the corresponding pair of individuals.

For a subset of individuals, the communication costs can be measured in different ways. 
For a set of individuals $\persons$, we denote the communication cost as $\cost(\persons)$. 
In \cite{lappas2009finding}, the diameter of the graph and minimum spanning tree (MST) are used as two different communication costs.
Many of the subsequent team formation papers study these same two measurements.
In our paper, however, we start with a simpler cost, which is just the sum of edge weights.
We later study other costs such as diameter and MST. 

Unlike communication cost, the utility of a subset of individuals depends on the task they aim to perform. 
For a task $\task$, coverage $\cov(\persons,\task)$ is the subset of skills that $\persons$ possess.
More formally $\cov(\persons,\task) = |\skill(\persons) \cap \task|$.
The utility of a group $ \persons $ is $\util(\persons,\task) = \frac{\cov(\persons, \task)}{|\task|}$.
Now, given a task distribution $\tasks$, we express the expected utility of a group as 

$$\mathbb{E}[\util(\persons,\tasks)] = \sum_{\task \sim \tasks } Pr[\task] \times \util(\persons, \task) $$ \\

\begin{comment}
The nodes in graph $\org(\nodes, \edges)$, represented by the set $\nodes = \{\hiredset \cup \candidates\}$, denote the people. As can be seen that it includes the people that are present in the organization already $\hiredset$ and the set of candidates $\candidates$. The edge set of graph $\org$ is denoted by $\edges$. An edge $\edge \in \edges$ is weighted, the weight $\weight(\edge)$ denotes the communication cost between the two people which are the endpoints of $\edge$. We assume the weight of all the edges involving even the candidates are known. 

Further we use the notation $\org_{\nodes'}$ to denote the induced sub graph of $\org$ taken over the node set $\nodes'$.
 



\subsubsection{Utility of an hire}
The utility of the hire depends on the people who are hired and the tasks for which they are hired. Precisely we assume the $\utility(\org_{\nodes'},\task)$ denotes the utility of a node set $\nodes'$, people who are hired, for a task $\task \in \tasks$. The overall utility can then be computed as,
$$\utility(\org_{\nodes'}, \tasks) = \sum_{i} Pr[T_i] \times \utility (\org_{\nodes'}, \task) $$

Given this utility measure, we next proceed to define the expected gain from a possible hire set. Recall $\hireset$ denotes a possible set of hiring. Then the gain of this hire is,
$$\gain(\hireset) = \utility(\org_{\hiredset \cup \hireset},\tasks) - \utility(\org_{\hiredset},\tasks) $$

We are now ready to define our problem of hiring a team that maximizes hiring utility.
\end{comment}

Equipped with these definitions, we are now ready to formally introduce the problems that we study in this paper.

\subsection{Problems}

We study two specific problems relevant to an organization.
The first problem is a maximization problem, where the aim is to hire a set of individuals from a candidate set, that would maximize the benefit of the hiring.
The second is a minimization problem, where the aim is to fire a set of people from the organization such that the impact of the firing is minimized.
In the rest of this section, we define these problems formally and study their complexity.

\subsubsection{Hiring problem}

For this problem we consider as input: an existing organization of people $\hiredset$, a candidate pool $\candidates$ from which to select new hires to the organization, and a budget $k$ that denotes the maximum number of people that can be hired.
We use cost and utility functions as defined above, and concern ourselves only with the nontrivial case where $k < |\candidates|$.
The problem may be formally defined as follows:
\begin{problem}
[HireMax] Given $\hiredset$, communication cost $\cost$ between every pair of individuals and task distribution $\tasks$, hire a set $X$ of $k$ persons (i.e. $|X| = k$) from the candidate pool $\candidates$ such that the ratio $\frac{\util(X, \tasks)}{\cost(X)}$ is maximized.
\end{problem}

We now show that $HireMax$ is NP-complete.
\begin{theorem}
HireMax is NP-complete.
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection{Firing problem}

The firing problem takes as input: an existing organization of people $\hiredset$, a budget $k$ that denotes the number of people to be fired, and the cost and communication functions as defined above. 
The candidates to be fired are the set of people currently employed. 
Formally speaking, the problem is the following:
\begin{problem}
[MinFire] Given $\hiredset$, communication cost $\cost$ between every pair of individuals and task distribution $\tasks$, fire a set $X$ of $k$ persons (i.e. $|X| = k$) such that the ratio $\frac{\util(X, \tasks)}{\cost(X)}$ is minimized.
\end{problem}

We now show that $MinFire$ is NP-complete.
\begin{theorem}
MinFire is NP-complete.
\end{theorem}
