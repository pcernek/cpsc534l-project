	annotate={Generalizes previous variants of TF under a single framework, showing that it's an unconstrained submodular function maximization problem, though it is non-monotone.
	Their generalizations include accounting for "optional" skills, allowing communication to go outside the team, and relaxing the constraint that the whole team be connected.
	Experiments use the DBLP dataset.}

	pages={1077--1088},
	year={2013},
	organization={ACM},
	annotate={Generalizes the TF problem by incorporating more ``realistic'' constraints, such as team leaders, max team sizes, and geographic locality.
	Their formulation results in a generalized version of the ``densest subgraph problem'' with cardinality constraints, for which they then develop an approximation via a continuous relaxation.
	Worth looking at to see what their ``broader range of team formation problems'' are.}
